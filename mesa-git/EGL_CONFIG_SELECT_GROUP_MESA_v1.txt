    EGL Extension #XXX

Extension Type

    EGL client extension

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the wording of the 2014.08.27 revision
    of the EGL 1.5 Specification.

Overview

    This extension provides a mechanism to lower the config selection priority 
    of the configs returned by eglChooseConfig. A new config attribute is
    introduced, providing a way for servers to group configs into different
    config selection categories.  The config selection priorities of all the
    configs in one category may be higher or lower than the ones in other
    categories.  The config selection priorities in one category follow the
    rules of eglChooseConfig.  The new attribute is invisible to users so it
    can't be queried by eglGetConfigAttrib.

New Types

    Accepted as the value of the EGLConfig attribute EGL_TRANSPARENT_TYPE:

        EGL_CONFIG_SELECT_GROUP_MESA                0x31D9

Additions to the EGL 1.5 Specification

    In section 3.4 "Configuration Management", under the "Buffer Descriptions
    and Attributes" heading, append to table 3.1 the following:
    
    "EGL_CONFIG_SELECT_GROUP_MESA | integer | the config select group" 
    
    In section 3.4 "Configuration Management", under the "Other EGLConfig
    Attribute Descriptions" heading, append to the end the following:

    "The attribute EGL_CONFIG_SELECT_GROUP_MESA is used to specify the config
    selection category of the config. Configs in the i-th category have a higher
    config selection priority than those found in the (i+1)-th category.
    
    "The attribute EGL_CONFIG_SELECT_GROUP_MESA is used for communication
    between servers and the EGL client. It is not accepted by the <attrib_list>
    parameter of eglChooseConfig, nor is it accepted as the <attribuite> in
    eglGetConfigAtrrib." 
    
    In section 3.4 "Configuration Management", under the "Sorting of EGLConfigs"
    heading, append to table 3.4 the following: 
    
    "EGL_CONFIG_SELECT_GROUP_MESA | 0 | Ignore | Smaller | 0" 
    
    In section 3.4 "Configuration Management", under the "Sorting of EGLConfigs"
    heading, append before the list entry which starts with "1. Special: by
    EGL_CONFIG_CAVEAT" the following entry:

    "0. Smaller EGL_CONFIG_SELECT_GROUP_MESA."
